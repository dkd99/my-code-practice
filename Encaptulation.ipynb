        "\n",
        "We have renamed the balance attribute to _balance (the underscore indicates it's private by convention).\n",
        "The idea is that _balance should not be accessed or modified directly outside the class.\n",
        "Getter Method balance:\n",
        "\n",
        "The @property decorator creates a getter method, allowing you to access the balance using account.balance.\n",
        "This provides controlled access to the private _balance attribute.\n",
        "Controlled Modifications with deposit and withdraw:\n",
        "\n",
        "The deposit and withdraw methods allow controlled modifications of _balance.\n",
        "The deposit method checks that the amount is positive, while the withdraw method ensures that the withdrawal amount is valid.\n",
        "Advantages of Using Private Attributes:\n",
        "Data Integrity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Private attributes prevent the balance from being set to an invalid value (like a negative number).\n",
        "The methods ensure that the balance is only modified in valid ways.\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The internal representation of the balance is hidden from the user.\n",
        "Even if the internal logic changes (e.g., if we change how the balance is calculated), the external interface (the deposit, withdraw, and balance methods) remains the same.\n",
        "Validation and Error Handling:\n",
        "\n",
        "By controlling access to _balance through methods, you can add validation checks, such as ensuring deposits are positive and withdrawals don't exceed the balance.\n",
        "Summary:\n",
        "Private attributes in Python help protect the internal state of an object from unintended or unauthorized access. By using private attributes and controlling access through methods (getters and setters), you can ensure data integrity, encapsulate internal logic, and provide a safer and more maintainable interface for interacting with your objects."
